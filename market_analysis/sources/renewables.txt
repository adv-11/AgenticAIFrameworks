Read documentation cross Renewables Energy system Renewables Overview Tracking Programmes Why are renewables important? Renewables, including solar, wind, hydropower, biofuels and others, are at the centre of the transition to less carbon-intensive and more sustainable energy systems. Generation capacity has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by policy support and sharp cost reductions for solar photovoltaics and wind power in particular. What is the role of renewables in clean energy transitions? The deployment of renewables in the power, heat and transport sectors is one of the main enablers of keeping the rise in average global temperatures below 1.5°C. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario, renewables allow electricity generation to be almost completely decarbonised. Meanwhile, renewable transport fuels and renewable heat contribute to significant emissions reductions in transport, buildings and industry. What are the challenges? The electricity sector remains the brightest spot for renewables with the strong growth of solar photovoltaics and wind in recent years, building on the already significant contribution of hydropower. But electricity accounts for only a fifth of global energy consumption and finding a greater role for renewable energy sources in transportation and heating remains critical to the energy transition.

In this sector Solar PV Previous page Wind Previous page Hydroelectricity Previous page Bioenergy Previous page Latest findings The global power mix is set to transform by 2030 Global renewable electricity generation is forecast to climb to over 17 000 terawatt-hours (TWh) by the end of this decade, an increase of almost 90% from 2023. This would be enough to meet the combined power demand of China and the United States in 2030. Over the next five years, several renewable energy milestones are expected to be reached. In 2025, renewables-based electricity generation is set to overtake coal-fired generation. In 2026, wind and solar power generation are each poised to surpass power generation from nuclear. Then, in 2029, electricity generation from solar PV is set to surpass hydropower, becoming the largest renewable power source globally – with wind-based generation expected to surpass hydropower in 2030. Renewables 2024 circle-arrow Share of renewable electricity generation by technology, 2000-2030 Open expand Tracking Renewables More efforts needed Renewables play a critical role in clean energy transitions. The deployment of renewables for electricity generation, for heat production for buildings and industry, and in transport is one of the main enablers of keeping average global temperature rise below 1.5°C. Modern bioenergy is today the largest source of renewable energy globally, with a more than 50% share of global use in 2023. Bioenergy is discussed separately, and this page is dedicated to other renewable technologies. Recent progress has been promising, and 2023 was a record year for renewable electricity capacity growth, with annual additions amounting to about 560 GW. Key policies announced in 2022, especially REPowerEU in the European Union, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the United States and China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy, will lend further support to accelerate renewable electricity deployment in the coming years. Solar PV is today the only renewable energy technology on track with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario. Wind, hydro, geothermal, solar thermal and ocean energy use needs to expand significantly faster in order to get on track. Non-bioenergy renewables need to increase their share of total energy supply from close to 6% today to approximately 16% by 2030 in the NZE Scenario. To achieve this, annual renewable energy use must increase at an average rate of about 15% during 2024-2030, close to quadruple of the average growth in the past 5 years. Country and regional highlights Chevron down New policies introduced in the recent years in the biggest global economies are expected to boost renewable energy use New policies introduced in the recent years in the biggest global economies are expected to boost renewable energy use Countries and regions making notable progress in advancing renewables include: China continues to lead in terms of renewable electricity capacity additions, with almost 350 GW added in 2023, two-thirds all global deployment. The 14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy, released in 2022, provides ambitious targets for renewable energy use, which should spur investment in the coming years. The European Union is accelerating solar PV and wind deployment in response to the energy crisis, with almost 80 GW added in 2023, double of pre-crisis 2021 growth. New policies and targets proposed in the REPowerEU Plan and The Green Deal Industrial Plan are expected to be important drivers of renewable energy investments in the coming years. The United States announced important new funding in 2022 under the IRA, which is expected to advance deployment of renewables in the medium term, and to boost investment in both power plants and equipment manufacturing. India remains committed to its ambitious target of reaching 500 GW of non-fossil power capacity in 2030. In April 2023, it announced a plan to auction 50 GW of new capacity annually to fulfil this goal. CO2 emissions Chevron down Renewables expansion is the major contributor to CO2 emission reductions up to 2030 in the NZE Scenario Renewables expansion is the major contributor to CO2 emission reductions up to 2030 in the NZE Scenario Renewables, in particular wind and solar technologies, are responsible for one of the largest shares of global CO2 emission reductions between now and 2030 in the NZE Scenario. They offer an alternative to investment in new fossil fuel power generation plants and displace generation from existing units. In the NZE Scenario, renewable power in the form of direct electricity use or indirect use, e.g. in the form of renewable hydrogen, is expected to displace the majority of fossil fuels use in end-use sectors, especially industry and transport. Renewable heat sources like modern bioenergy, geothermal plants and solar heaters will also play a major role in decarbonisation of the heating sector. Energy Chevron down The increase in renewables as a share of energy supply in 2022 was the second largest in history, but even faster increases are needed to align with the NZE Scenario The increase in renewables as a share of energy supply in 2022 was the second largest in history, but even faster increases are needed to align with the NZE Scenario Renewables share of total energy supply in the Net Zero Scenario, 2010-2030 Open expand In 2023, renewable energy supply from solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and ocean rose by over 5%, meaning that the share of these technologies in total global energy supply increased by close to 0.2 percentage points, reaching 5.7%. Modern bioenergy's share in 2023 increased by the same amount, reaching 6.5%. The supply of renewables needs to accelerate to reach around 15% expansion annually over 2024-2030 to align with the NZE Scenario. Despite record renewable electricity capacity additions in 2023, supply growth was still significantly below that level. Much faster deployment of all renewable technologies in all regions of the world will be needed to put the world on track with the NZE Scenario. Technology deployment Chevron down Accelerating wind and solar PV capacity additions are driving the growth in renewable energy supply, but activity needs to ramp up rapidly to align with the NZE Scenario Accelerating wind and solar PV capacity additions are driving the growth in renewable energy supply, but activity needs to ramp up rapidly to align with the NZE Scenario Renewable energy supply by technology in the Net Zero Scenario, 2010-2030 Open expand Electricity generation from renewables accounts for about 42% of the total renewable energy supply. For non-bioenergy renewable sources, this share is as high as 82% with the remainder in the form of heat produced in solar thermal and geothermal installations. Solar PV evenly accounted for about 70% of 2023’s growth in renewable electricity generation of over 460 TWh. The rest of the growth came from wind generation, while hydropower generation decreased. Electricity and heat generation growth in geothermal, concentrated solar power (CSP) and ocean technologies mostly stalled in 2023 due to limited capacity additions. In total, in 2023 non-bioenergy renewable sources accounted for almost 30% of electricity generation. Solar PV has been the fastest growing technology by capacity additions in recent years and is aligned with the NZE Scenario. In the case of wind, hydropower and bioenergy, more efforts are needed to get on track, as growth in recent years and that expected in the near future is significantly below required levels. Other less widely used renewable technologies, such as CSP, geothermal and ocean power, are not on track and require a rapid step-up in support. Policy Chevron down Positive policy developments in China, the European Union, the United States and India will drive faster renewables growth in the coming years Positive policy developments in China, the European Union, the United States and India will drive faster renewables growth in the coming years Renewable electricity is subject to policy support and national targets in the majority of countries around the world. Various types of support have been implemented, including technology-specific measures. The following important changes have been implemented in the past couple of years: China published its 14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy in June 2022, which includes an ambitious target of 33% of electricity generation to come from renewables by 2025 (up from about 29% in 2021) and, for the first time, a target for renewable heat use. In August 2022 the federal government of the United States introduced the IRA, which significantly expands support for renewable energy in the next ten years through tax credits and other measures. In May 2022 the European Commission proposed to increase the European Union’s renewable energy target for 2030 to 45% as part of the REPowerEU Plan (which would require 1 236 GW of total installed renewable capacity). Many European countries have already expanded their renewables support mechanisms in order to accelerate renewable power and heat use with a view to the 2030 targets and in response to the energy crisis resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition, in February 2023 the Commission announced The Green Deal Industrial Plan, aiming to support the expansion of clean energy technology manufacturing. During COP26, held in November 2021 in Glasgow, India announced new targets for 2030, comprising 500 GW of total non-fossil electricity generating capacity and a 50% renewable electricity generation share (more than double the 22% share in 2020), as well as net zero emissions by 2070. View all renewables policies Policies and Measures database (PAMS) circle-arrow Recommendations 1 Ensure renewable energy policy stability and predictability Chevron down For all renewable power and heat technologies, long-term targets and policy stability are essential to ensure investor confidence and continued growth. At the same time, policies need to adapt continuously to changing market conditions to achieve greater cost-competitiveness and to improve the integration of renewables into the energy system. 2 Focus on an energy system perspective Chevron down Achieving a high penetration of renewable power and heat technologies is a necessary condition to decarbonise many carbon-intensive sectors of the economy, including heavy industry, construction and transport. The expansion of renewable hydrogen use, emissions-free heating in buildings, and electric vehicles requires an integrated approach, connecting the utilisation of all renewable energy technologies. Policy makers should focus on implementing long-term plans for whole-economy decarbonisation and implement incentives reflecting the requirements of all economic sectors. 3 Shift policy to competitive auctions Chevron down Policy instruments used to support renewable power include administratively set feed-in tariffs or premiums, renewable portfolio standards, quotas and tradeable green certificate schemes, net metering, tax rebates and capital grants. Recently, auctions for the centralised competitive procurement of renewables have become increasingly widespread and have been instrumental in discovering renewable energy prices and containing policy costs in many countries, especially for solar PV and wind. The success of such policies in achieving deployment and development objectives relies on their design and consequent ability to attract investment and competition. 4 Adjust policy design to integrate variable renewables Chevron down Increasingly competitive, renewables – especially solar PV and wind – are rapidly transforming power systems worldwide. However, reforms to power market design and policy frameworks will be needed to ensure investment at scale both in new renewable capacity and in power system flexibility to integrate high shares of variable renewables in a reliable and cost-effective manner. As the share of variable renewable energy increases, policies ensuring investment in all forms of flexibility become crucial. Solutions include enhancing power plant flexibility, unlocking demand-side management, supporting energy storage and improving grid infrastructure. 5 Address technology-specific challenges Chevron down Some renewable technologies are still relatively expensive and/or face specific technology and market challenges, so they require more targeted policies. Better remuneration of the market value of storage is necessary to accelerate deployment of CSP, pumped-hydro storage and reservoir hydropower technologies. Timely grid connection and continued implementation of policies that spur competition are needed to achieve further cost reductions in offshore wind. Improving the competitiveness of renewable heating technologies through support policies is necessary to accelerate their deployment. 6 Facilitate permitting for new projects and modernisation Chevron down Lengthy and complicated permitting processes are hampering deployment of new renewable capacity, especially in Europe. Due to complicated requirements, responsibility being split between multiple government agencies and understaffing, the development of renewable energy projects can take up to ten years. Establishing “one-stop shops”, providing clear guidance for developers and increasing support of public agencies in site identification should be considered by policy makers to remove bottlenecks on permitting.
