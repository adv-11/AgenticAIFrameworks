Long term memory with langGraph 

Semantic Memory: Stores core facts and user preferences (e.g., “User prefers dark mode” or “Alice works in marketing”). This knowledge forms a persistent base that the AI can reference during interactions.

Episodic Memory: Captures complete experiences, including the context and reasoning behind an interaction. Think of it as a diary where the agent notes “what happened” and “how it was resolved.”

Procedural Memory: Encodes behavioral patterns and evolving instructions. It’s like the agent’s operating manual that gets refined as it learns from feedback.


Examples 

Semantic Memory:
Automatically captures facts and knowledge. For example, if a user mentions they “prefer dark mode,” that detail is stored and later recalled when discussing UI settings.


Episodic Memory:
By capturing entire interaction episodes, the agent learns not just facts but also effective communication strategies. This allows for fine-tuning responses based on what worked well in the past


Procedural Memory:
The SDK includes prompt optimizers that evolve the agent’s instructions over time. This means that if the agent repeatedly receives feedback on how to improve its explanations, its system prompt can be updated dynamically to enhance future responses.
